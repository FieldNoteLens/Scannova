    <h1>Privacy Policy for Scannova</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Scannova ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how your data is collected, used, and stored when you use the Scannova iOS application ("App").
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>By installing or using Scannova, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Documents and Images</h3>
    <p>
        Scannova enables you to scan, organize, and manage documents directly on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        All images, scans, and extracted text are stored locally using Apple's Core Data framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>No document or image data is ever uploaded, transmitted, or accessible to us or to third parties.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Camera and Photo Library Access</h3>
    <p>
        To provide scanning functionality, Scannova may request permission to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> used only to capture documents through Apple's VisionKit.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> used to import existing photos or to export your scanned documents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Permissions are requested using iOS's standard system prompts, and you may revoke them anytime in Settings > Privacy.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</h3>
    <p>
        Scannova uses Apple's Vision framework for text recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
        All OCR processing is performed entirely on-device.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognized text is stored locally and never leaves your device.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Optional Usage Analytics</h3>
    <p>
        Scannova includes a local-only analytics module to help you understand your own app usage (e.g., number of scans, session duration).
    </p>
    <p>
        This data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>stays on your device;</li>
        <li>is not shared, transmitted, or linked to your identity;</li>
        <li>can be deleted by uninstalling the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.5 Crash and Diagnostic Data</h3>
    <p>
        If you choose to share crash or performance data with Apple through iOS Settings > Privacy > Analytics & Improvements, Apple may share anonymized diagnostic data with developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not directly receive or store this data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is used only on your device to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>perform document scanning and OCR;</li>
        <li>organize and search your documents;</li>
        <li>enhance app functionality and performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not sell, track, profile, or build user analytics across devices.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        All user content remains stored locally within Scannova's secure sandbox on your iOS device.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apple's system security (including Data Protection, File System Encryption, and Face ID/Touch ID) safeguards your data.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not maintain external databases or cloud backups.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use iCloud Backup or device transfer, Apple may include Scannova's local data in your encrypted iCloud backup under your Apple ID.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Scannova does not share any user data with third parties for marketing, analytics, or advertising.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The only times your data may leave your device are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>when you choose to share a file using iOS share extensions (e.g., AirDrop, Mail, Files app, Messages);</li>
        <li>or when your device performs an iCloud backup, managed solely by Apple.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You fully control all sharing actions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Scannova is intended for general audiences and not designed for children under 13.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect or store any information about children.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you believe a child under 13 has used the app and provided data, please contact us and we will guide you on secure deletion procedures.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
        You have full control over your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> View your scans and text directly in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove documents manually or uninstall the app to erase all stored data.</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> Use built-in export or share features (PDF, JPEG, PNG, TXT).</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Manage Camera and Photo Library permissions in iOS Settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Uninstalling Scannova permanently deletes all locally stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new app features or regulatory requirements.
    </p>
